# Day: 4 Loops

### It is a part of 30 days of javascript challenge by chai aur code

<br>

## Activity 1: Performing operations with for loop
- Using for keyword to print numbers from 1 to 10.
```js
// Performing operation with for loop

// Using for keyword
for(i=1; i<=10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
```
- Using for keyword to print the multiplication table of 5.
- mul = 5 * i 
```js
// Performing operation with for loop 

// Using for keyword
for(i=1; i<=10; i++){
    mul = 5 * i;
    console.log(`5 x ${i} = ${mul}`);    
}
```

## Activity 2: Performing operation with while loop
- Using while keyword to print sum of numbers from 1 to 10.
- sum = i + i
```js
// Performing operation with while loop

// Using while keyword
i=1;
while(i<=10){
    sum = i + i;
    console.log(`${i} + ${i} = ${sum}`); 
    i++;
}
```
- Using while keyword to print numbers from 10 to 1. 
```js
// Performing operation with while loop

// Using while keyword
let i = 10;
while(i>=1){
    console.log(i);
    i--;
}
```

## Activity 3: Performing operation with do... while loop
- Using do, while keywords to print numbers from 1 to 5.
- This type of loop start execution first than it checks condition.
```js
// Performing operation with do... while loop

// Using do, while keywords.
let i = 1;
do{
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}while(i<=5);
```
- Using do, while keywords to calculate the factorial of a number.
- if fact = 1 then fact = fact * i

## [Code of Task 6](Task_6.js)
<br>

## Activity 4: Performing operation with nested loops
- Using for keyword to print stars.
- assign var i and j for 2 different loops.
- assign var str for empty string.
- compare equals to str to * and to space '\n'.

## [Code of Activity 4](Task_7.js)

<br>

## Activity 5: Peforming operation with loop control statements
- Using continue keyword to skip the number 5.
- Using break keyword to stop the loop when the number is 7 came.
