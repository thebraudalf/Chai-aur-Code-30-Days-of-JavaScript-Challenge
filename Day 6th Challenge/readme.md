# Day: 6 Array

### It is a part of 30 days of javascript challenge by chai aur code

<br>

## Activity 1: Creation of array and access
- Using "[]" square brackets to create an array of numbers from 1 to 5
- Using array[0] property to access first element of the array. 
- Using array[array.length-1] to access last element of the array.

## [Code of Activity 1](Task_1_and_2.js)

<br>

## Activity 2: Performing operation with array methods (Basic) 
- Using "[]" square brackets to create an array of numbers from 1 to 5
- Using push() method to add element in the array
- Using pop() method to remove last element in the array
- Using shift() method to remove the first element from the array
- Using unshift() method to add element in the beginning of array

## [Code of Activity 2](Task_3_to_6.js)

<br>

## Activity 3: Performing operation with array methods (Intermediate)
- Using map() method to create a new array where each no. is doubled.
- give accumlator e then e * 2
- Using filter() method to create a new array with only even numbers
- give accumulator e then e % 2 == 0
- Using reduce() method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array
- give accumulator and currentValue e1 & e2 then e1 + e2

## [Code of Activity 3](Task_7_to_9.js)

<br>

## Activity 4: Performing operation with array iterations
- Using for loop to iterate over the array.
- give condition i < array.length and log array[i]
- Using for each loop to iterate over the array.
- give accumulator e then log e

## [Code of Activity 4](Task_10_and_11.js)

<br>

## Activity 5: Peforming operation with multi dimensional array
- Creating a two dimensional array.
- put array inside array
- Accessing a specific element from the two dimensional array.
- log array[3][1]

## [Code of Activity 5](Task_12_and_13.js)
