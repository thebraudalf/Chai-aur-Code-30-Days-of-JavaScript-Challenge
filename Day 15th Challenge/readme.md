# Day: 15 Closures
### It is a part of 30 days of javascript challenge by chai aur code

<br>

## Activity 1: Understanding Closures
- Writing a function that returns another function, where a inner function accesses a variable of the outer function's scope.
- Creating a closure that maintains a private counter to increment and to get value.

## [Code of Activity 1](./Task_1_and_2.js)

<br>

## Activity 2: Practical Closures
- Writing a function that generates unique id's. Using a closure to keep track of last generated ID and increment it with each call.
- Creating a closure that captures username and return greet function which return by username.

## [Code of Activity 2](./Task_3_and_4.js)

<br>

## Activity 3: Closures in Loops
- Writing a loop that creates an array of functions. Each function logs its index value when called. Using closure to ensure its each function.

## [Code of Activity 3](./Task_5.js)

<br>

## Activity 4: Module Pattern
- Using closure to create a simple module for managing collection of items. Implementing methods to add, remove, and list items.

## [Code of Activity 4](./Task_6.js)

<br>

## Activity 5: Memoization
-  Writing a function that memoizes the result of another function. Using a closure to store the result of previous computations.
- Creating a memoized version of function that calculates the factorial of number.

## [Code of Activity 5](./Task_7_and_8.js)
